# F1 race results analysis

Bayesian multilevel binomial regression model was implemented to represent each individual finishing position of each race in years 2017-2021 by separating F1 drivers skills from the advantage of their teams. The point of this model was to create performance ratings for independent components contributing to success. 

Having these performance ratings for each of the drivers and each of the constructors it is possible to predict race results for any driver-constructor pair (e.g. predict the performance of the worst driver in the best car).

Dataset contains a collection of race results (driver name, constructor name, season (year), race number, finishing position and status) for the 2014-2021 Formula 1 seasons from the [Ergast motorsports API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).
